death Whitman
To think of to-day, and the ages continued henceforward!
Have you guess'd you yourself would not continue?
Have you dreaded these earth - beetles?
Have you fear'd the future would be nothing to you?
To think that we are now here, and bear our part!
Not a day passes — not a minute or second, without a corpse!
The dull nights go over, and the dull days also,
He is decently put away — is there anything more?
The sky continues beautiful,
Yourself! Yourself! Yourself, forever and ever!
Pleasantly and well-suited I walk,
How perfect the earth, and the minutest thing upon it!
What is called good is perfect, and what is called bad is just \n as perfect,
