death Whitman
To think of to-day, and the ages continued henceforward!
Have you guess'd you yourself would not continue?
Have you dreaded these earth - beetles?
Have you fear'd the future would be nothing to you?
To think that we are now here, and bear our part!
Not a day passes — not a minute or second, without a corpse!
The dull nights go over, and the dull days also,
He is decently put away — is there anything more?
The sky continues beautiful,
Yourself! Yourself! Yourself, forever and ever!
Pleasantly and well-suited I walk,
How perfect the earth, and the minutest thing upon it!
What is called good is perfect, and what is called bad is just \n as perfect,

love Shakespeare
From fairest creatures we desire increase, \nthat thereby beauty's rose might never die.
Those hours, that with gentle work did frame \nthe lovely gaze where every eye doth dwell.
Not from the stars do I my judgment pluck; and yet methinks I have astronomy.
Let me confess that we two must be twain, Although our undivided loves are one.
O, how thy worth with manners may I sing, When thou art all the better part of me.
Mine eye and heart are at a mortal war How to divide the conquest of thy sight.
Against that time, if ever that time come, When I shall see thee frown on my defects,
So are you to my thoughts as food to life, Or as sweet-season'd showers are to the ground.
